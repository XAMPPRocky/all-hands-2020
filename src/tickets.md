# Tickets and sponsorship

As always, it is our intention that **nobody should have to pay to
attend the All Hands**. However, the costs of the event must be
covered, and we’re also aware that many of the people attending do
have an employer who would be able and willing to cover the price of a
ticket. Therefore, we’ve opted for the following setup.

When registering, you will be asked to answer the following two
questions. Note that you are welcome to respond "yes" to both.

- **Do you need your flights + hotel sponsored?**
- **Do you need your event ticket sponsored?**

Please feel free to request sponsorship as necessary. However, if your
company is able to purchase tickets to the event, you have the
following options. **Note that each ticket includes admittance for
exactly one person to the event, regardless of how many people it pays
for.** Please contact us at <rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org> if you want
to bring someone along, and see the FAQ as well.

- **“Individual” ticket: 500€.** A “individual” ticket covers roughly the cost for a single person to attend the all hands, including catering and venue.
- **“Solidarity” ticket:** **1000€.** A “solidarity” ticket is a lightweight form of sponsorship. It covers the cost for yourself and then sponsors the cost of one other ticket.
- **“Sponsorship” ticket: 5000€.** A “sponsorship” ticket covers the cost for yourself as well as nine other people. If your company is interested in purchasing one of these tickets, reach out to the event organizers.
    - Sponsoring companies will be publicly acknowledged in a blog post and thanked during and after the event.

## Sponsorship
If your company would like to sponsor, that's great! Please send us
mail at <rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org> and we'll figure out the
details.

> *My company would like to sponsor, but doesn't have any Rust project members
  attending, can they still sponsor the event?*

Yes, attendance is not a requirement for sponsorship.
