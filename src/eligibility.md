# Eligibility

In general, we intend the event to be open to people who are
actively participating in the Rust organization. In some cases, that's
a bit hard to define precisely.

## Inclusiveness

It is our intention for the All Hands to be an inclusive event. We
would like in particular that every contributor should be able to
attend, independent of their financial and social status. For this
reason, we will provide sponsorship as well as support remote
participation.

## Team members and working group participants

Our intent is that the event is open to active participants in the
Rust organization. This includes both teams and working
groups. However, in many cases it can be somewhat hard to define who
is an "active participant". Therefore, we leave some of the judgement
calls up to the leads of the relevant group.

Our official rule is that **all team members** are invited as well as
**working group leads**.  Beyond that, team leads and working group
leads can opt to make additional invitations as appropriate.
Leads can contact <rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org> with
questions about how to do so.

Anyone actively involved in the Rust organization is eligible for
sponsorship to cover the travel and ticket prices. See the [ticket
page](./tickets.html) for more details.

## Other folks

In addition, we sometimes extend invitations to additional folks who
have specific things to discuss with team members. We may include
people who live in the area where the All Hands is taking place,
researchers working on an interesting proposal, or production users
looking to build involvement with the Rust organization.

**People not actively involved in the Rust organization are not automatically
eligible for sponsorship, however.**

If you are interested in attending, but not sure if you qualify, or
would like to discuss sponsorship, please send an e-mail to
<rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org>.

## Remote access

If you are interested in participating in a particular meeting, but
are not able to attend the event in person, please let team leads and
organizers know and we will make a best effort to enable remote
participation.
