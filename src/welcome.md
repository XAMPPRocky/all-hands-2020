# Welcome

Welcome to the webpage for the Rust All Hands 2020! This site should
contain all the information you need about the event.

## What is the Rust All Hands?

The Rust All Hands is an annual event where Rust team members and
other people actively involved in the Rust community get together for
high-bandwidth work. It offers us a chance to push on designs, look at
tricky implementation problems, and to make plans for the remainder of
the year. The details of how each Rust team or working group makes use
of the All Hands will vary, but that's the idea.

## When and where is the Rust All Hands?

This year the all hands event will be hosted by the [University of
Macedonia][uom] in **Thessaloniki, Greece** from the **16th to 20th** of March
2020. See our [location page] for further information as well as
hotel recommendations.
